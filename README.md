## Preview Portfolio

You can view a live preview of the portfolio here [https://portfolio-template-for-artists.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-template-for-artists.vercel.app/).

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** This website is fully responsive across all devices.
- **Dynamic Content:** Artists can enter their data and upload portfolio items to receive a ZIP file of the source code with their content.

## Portfolio Website

> [!NOTE]
> The Source Code for this portfolio can be found in the [Portfolio](https://github.com/rakshixh/Portfolio-Template-For-Artists/tree/main/Portfolio) folder in the repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Frontend is deployed in `Vercel` where as Backend is deployed in `Render`, since both are of `free tier` sometimes there will be an `error` or `delay of 50 seconds` for response from the backend. It is recommended to retry in case of an error!
